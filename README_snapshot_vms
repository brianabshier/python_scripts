Description:
------------
This script automates the creation of snapshots for all active OpenStack instances
in your project. It also cleans up old snapshots beyond a configured retention count,
and tracks instances to detect when VMs are added or removed.

Features:
---------
- Authenticates using OpenStack API with provided credentials.
- Creates snapshots named with a prefix, instance name, and timestamp.
- Keeps a configurable number of snapshots per instance (retention policy).
- Tracks instance changes between runs.
- Supports staggering snapshot creation to avoid resource spikes.
- Saves instance state in a local JSON file.

Requirements:
-------------
- Python 3.x
- openstacksdk library (`pip install openstacksdk`)
- Access to OpenStack with API credentials

Usage:
------
1. Configure your OpenStack authentication parameters in the script (AUTH_ARGS).
2. Optionally adjust settings like:
   - SNAPSHOT_PREFIX (default: "auto-snap")
   - SNAPSHOT_RETENTION (default: 3)
   - STAGGER_SECONDS (default: 10)
   - DATA_FILE (state file location)
3. Run the script:
   python snapshot_vms.py
Schedule this script using cron or another scheduler for regular snapshots.

Notes:
- The script stores instance state in a JSON file (vm_state.json by default).
- Ensure the script has write permission in its working directory.
- Snapshot names follow the pattern: auto-snap-<instance_name>-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
- Adjust retention to control how many snapshots to keep per instance.
