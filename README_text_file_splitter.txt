Text File Splitter

This Python script is designed to split a large text file into smaller files, each containing a specified number of lines. It provides a convenient way to break down large datasets or logs into more manageable chunks.

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x

Usage:

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script using the following command:

python text_file_splitter.py

5. Follow the on-screen prompts:
   - Enter the path to the input text file you want to split.
   - Enter the desired number of lines per output file.

6. Once the process completes, you will see a message indicating that the file splitting is completed.

Example:

Suppose you have a large text file named example.txt and you want to split it into files containing 100 lines each. Running the script and providing the input file path as example.txt and the number of lines per file as 100 will split the file into smaller files named example.txt_1.txt, example.txt_2.txt, and so on.
