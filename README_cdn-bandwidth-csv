Rackspace CDN Bandwidth Output JSON to CSV Converter

This Python script converts CDN/API bandwidth analytics JSON data into
human-readable CSV files. It processes per-region, per-day byte counts
and outputs both daily usage and total usage by region.

Usage:

Run the script with a JSON file as an argument.

The script generates CSV files in the same directory.

Example:

python bandwidth_to_csv.py data.json


Output:

<filename>_daily.csv — daily bandwidth usage by region

<filename>_region_totals.csv — total bandwidth usage per region

Notes:

Bandwidth is converted from bytes to GiB (1024³).

Uses Python standard library only.
